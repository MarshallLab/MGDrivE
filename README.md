# Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer


**MGDrivE** is a model designed to be a reliable testbed where various gene drive interventions for mosquito-borne diseases control. It is being developed to accommodate the use of various mosquito-specific gene drive systems within a population dynamics framework that allows migration of individuals between patches in landscape.

For more information take a look at our <a href="https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/">website</a>; where you'll find a thorough description, documentation and examples.

The documentation and vignettes depend on [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html), and [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html); which can be installed with the following command (in the _R_ console):

```R
install.packages(c("Rcpp","data.table","R6","Rdpack","roxygen2","knitr","rmarkdown"))
```

Once these packages are installed, the package can be installed with:

```R
