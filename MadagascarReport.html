<h1> Madagascar: Homing Drive</h1>

This is the first test in which we have used different population sizes on the nodes of our network.
Each node represents a city (as parsed from <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/knowledgebase/">Wolfram Knowledge Database</a>),
and the mosquito population each location is scaled proportionally to the amount of humans present at each location.

<h2>Results and Analysis</h2>

We present the results of running the simulation in our "flowchart" and "bleed-plots". In the "flowcharts" it is
apparent that there is a slow spread of the gene-drive in the initial days of the simulation. After fixation in the largest
population is achieved, however, the gene-drive takes over quickly over the remaining bits of the landscape.
In the "bleed-plots" the change in composition accross the landscape can be seen in a static image (<i>x-axis</i> being time, and <i>y-axis</i> being the node id),
in which we can confirm that the gene-drive is spreading according to the distances between cities.

<br><br><h2>Video</h2>

As this was an exploratory analysis to test the dynamics of gene-drives accross the landscapes with heterogoeneous mosquito population sizes, we exported a

time to load, depending on the internet connection).

<h2>Take-Aways and Other Ideas</h2>

The analysis of the heterogeneity in population sizes could be interesting because, from this limited test, it seems to change the dynamics of the gene-flows (comparing it to our previous experiments in which all the population sizes were homogeneous).
We need to come up with experiments and tools to analyze these phenomena.

<ul>
  <li>How do heterogeneous population sizes affect the dynamics of the gene-drive spread?</li>
  <li>Is it semi-analogous to other processes such as: water/heat sinks?</li>
  <li>What kind of analytical tools do we need to perform that spatio-temporal analysis?</li>
</ul>
