}
\description{
This function provides a unified interface to the various simulation algorithms
for SPN, returning output sampled at a lattice of time points to the user, and
handling various exogenous events that may occur during the simulation
(such as release of adult mosquitoes).
}
\details{
\code{dt_stoch} is used by the Poisson Time-Step (\code{\link{step_PTS}}) and
Chemical Langevin (\code{\link{step_CLE}}) methods to approximate the hazards.
A smaller \code{dt_stoch} provides a better approximation, but will take longer
to run.

The stoichiometry matrix (\code{S}) is generated in \code{\link{spn_S}}.

The list of hazards (\code{hazards}) come from \code{\link{spn_hazards}}.

Several samplers are provided. The default is a Poisson Time-Step
(\code{\link{step_PTS}}) method. Other options are Gillespie's Direct Method
(\code{\link{step_DM}}) and a Chemical Langevin sampler (\code{\link{step_CLE}}).
Additionally, for convenience, an ODE "sampler" (\code{\link{step_ODE}}) is
provided for compatibility with other samplers. This function uses methods from
\code{deSolve}.

If using the \code{ode} sampler, several \code{methods} are provided in the \code{deSolve}
package, see \code{\link[deSolve]{ode}}. For inhomogeneous systems, consider
using the "rk4" method to avoid excessive integration times.

Additionally, \code{events} objects must follow the format required by
\code{deSolve}. This was done for consistency, see \code{\link[deSolve]{events}}
for more information.

This function tracks state variables by default; an optional argument \code{Sout}
can be provided to track number of event firings each time step (for discrete stochastic simulations),
or cumulative intensity (for continuous stochastic simulations), or the rate function of
particular events for ODE simulation. The matrix must have number of columns equal to
number of events in the system (the number of hazard functions), and a row for each tracking
variable. The function \code{\link{track_hinf}} is provided, which builds a matrix to track
human infection events.

To save output as .csv files, see \code{\link{sim_trajectory_CSV}}.
