Please note, we are aware that we have another package "MGDrivE" on CRAN. MGDrivE2 is not a version update to MGDrivE (in fact we just updated MGDrivE to 1.6.0 this week). MGDrivE2 provides significantly different functionality than MGDrivE, such that the internal architecture is incompatible, and it is a different piece of software. We plan to support both packages with updates and bugfixes simultaneously, and therefore kindly request CRAN to consider MGDrivE2 a seperate piece of software.

This is a resubmission to replace broken URIs in vignettes.
